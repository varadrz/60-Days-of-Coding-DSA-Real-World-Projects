# Day 8 | Ride-Sharing Pair Matcher

## Overview
This project is part of the **60 Days of Coding | DSA x Real World Projects** series.

Day 8 focuses on the **Two Pointers technique** to efficiently match pickup and drop locations in a ride-sharing scenario.

---

## Problem Statement
Given pickup locations and drop locations, find the pair with the minimum distance between them.

---

## DSA Concepts Used
- Two Pointers
- Sorting
- Greedy traversal
- Absolute difference calculation

---

## How the Solution Works
- Sorts pickup and drop location arrays
- Uses two pointers to traverse both arrays
- Adjusts pointers to minimize distance efficiently

---

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (excluding sorting)

---

## How to Run
```bash
python day-8.py
