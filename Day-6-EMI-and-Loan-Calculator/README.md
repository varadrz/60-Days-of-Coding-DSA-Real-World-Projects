# Day 6 | EMI and Loan Calculator

## Overview
This project is part of the **60 Days of Coding | DSA x Real World Projects** series.

Day 6 focuses on applying **Mathematical concepts and numerical precision handling** to build a real-world **EMI and Loan Calculator**, similar to those used by banks and financial platforms.

---

## Problem Statement
Design a system that:
- Calculates monthly EMI for a loan
- Computes total payment over the loan tenure
- Determines total interest paid

The solution should handle floating-point precision accurately.

---

## DSA Concepts Used
- Mathematical formulas
- Exponentiation
- Precision handling
- Constant-time computation

---

## How the Solution Works
- Converts annual interest rate to monthly rate
- Applies standard EMI formula
- Handles zero-interest edge case
- Rounds results for financial accuracy

---

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## How to Run
```bash
python day-6.py
