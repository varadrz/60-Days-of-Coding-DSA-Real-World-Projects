# 60 DAYS OF CODING | DSA x REAL WORLD PROJECTS

## Day 1 | Expense Tracker Engine

### Overview
This project is part of the **60 Days of Coding | DSA x Real World Projects** initiative.  
Day 1 focuses on applying **fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms** to solve a practical and relatable problem, expense analysis.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how core DSA concepts such as arrays, hash maps, and sets can be used to efficiently process and analyze real world data.

The primary implementation is done using **Python** with a console based interface.  
An optional **HTML and JavaScript prototype** is included to show how the same DSA logic can be applied in a frontend environment.

### Problem Statement
Build an Expense Tracker Engine that allows a user to:
- Record unlimited daily expenses
- Calculate total expenses
- Compute average expense per day
- Generate category wise expense summaries

The focus is on algorithmic clarity and correctness rather than UI complexity.

---

### Tech Stack
**Primary**
- Python 3
- Console based execution using VS Code terminal

**Optional Prototype**
- HTML
- JavaScript

No external libraries, frameworks, or databases are used in Day 1.

---

### DSA Concepts Used
- **Array (List)** for storing expense records
- **Hash Map (Dictionary)** for category wise aggregation
- **Set** for tracking unique days
- **Single pass traversal** for efficient computation

---

### Features
- Add unlimited expense entries
- View total expense
- View average expense per day
- View category wise expense breakdown
- Simple and readable console output
