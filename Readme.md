# 60 DAYS OF CODING | DSA x REAL WORLD PROJECTS

## Overview
This repository documents my **60 Days of Coding** journey, focused on applying **Data Structures and Algorithms** to **real world problems** instead of isolated textbook exercises.

Each day in this repository contains:
- A clearly defined problem statement
- A DSA driven solution
- Clean and readable implementation
- Practical use case mapping

The goal is to build **strong algorithmic foundations** while developing the habit of writing **usable and explainable code**.

---

## Why This Repository
Most DSA practice stops at solving abstract problems.  
This repository bridges the gap between **DSA concepts** and **real software systems** by implementing small, focused projects that mirror real world scenarios.

Key principles followed:
- DSA first approach
- Minimal tooling
- No unnecessary frameworks
- Clarity over complexity
- Code that can be explained and defended in interviews

---

## Technology Focus
The primary language used across this repository is:
- **Python**

Supporting technologies may be used when relevant:
- HTML and JavaScript for simple frontend prototypes
- SQL or file based storage in later phases
- Backend frameworks only when the problem demands it

Tools are introduced **only when required**, not by default.
