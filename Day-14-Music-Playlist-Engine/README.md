# Day 14 | Music Playlist Engine

## Overview
This project is part of the **60 Days of Coding | DSA x Real World Projects** series.

Day 14 focuses on the **Linked List data structure** by implementing a Music Playlist Engine similar to how songs are stored and traversed in media players.

---

## Problem Statement
Design a system that:
- Stores songs in sequence
- Allows adding and removing songs
- Traverses and plays songs in order

---

## DSA Concepts Used
- Singly Linked List
- Node-based traversal
- Dynamic memory linking

---

## How the Solution Works
- Each song is stored as a node
- Nodes are linked using pointers
- Songs are added at the end of the list
- Songs can be removed dynamically
- Playlist is traversed sequentially

---

## Time and Space Complexity

### Operations
- Add song: O(n)
- Remove song: O(n)
- Traverse playlist: O(n)

### Space Complexity
- O(n), where n is the number of songs

---

## How to Run
```bash
python day-14.py
